## What is EKOKE

We're revolutionizing home financing by replacing traditional mortgages with a fair, decentralized alternative. Through our Ethereum powered Deferred NFT system, buyers can pay for their homes in manageable installments. Each NFT represents a payment, and once all are completed, ownership of the property is fully transferred. EKOKE DAO empowers members to invest in these NFTs, earning deflationary EKOKE tokens as rewards while supporting buyers with transparent and sustainable interest rates. By fostering community-driven home ownership, we eliminate the burden of excessive mortgage rates and create value for everyone involved. This innovative venture aspires to redefine real estate transactions by embracing the potential of the Ethereum and Internet Computer blockchains.

## Real estate focused

We're dedicated to making home ownership more accessible and affordable. Our project targets the real-estate market, thanks to our longstanding experience in the field and we believe that we can make a difference in people's lives

## Installments over mortgages

We're replacing traditional mortgages with unsastainable interest rates with a fair, decentralized alternative. Through our Ethereum powered Deferred NFT system, buyers can pay for their homes in manageable installments.

## Win-Win for Buyers, Sellers and Investors

We're creating a win-win situation for everyone involved.

- Buyers can pay for their homes in manageable installments.
- Sellers can sell their properties faster.
- Investors can earn rewards while supporting buyers.

## DAO Governance and Community Driven

Our project is community-driven and decentralized. We're building a DAO that will be governed by the community. We aim to launch the DAO governance on the Internet Computer NNS in order to make it fully decentralized. On the NNS the community will be able to vote to manage real estate agencies, ask for refunds in case of frauds, and much more.

## Web3 and Blockchain Technology

We're embracing the potential of the Ethereum and Internet Computer blockchains. Our project is powered by smart contracts and DAO governance. Even our Website is hosted on the Internet Computer blockchain and it's running in a canister. Our infrastructure is 100% decentralized and censorship-resistant.

## Sustainable, Transparent and Inflation Resistant

Our project is sustainable, transparent and inflation-resistant. We're using a deflationary token model for our EKOKE token. The total supply of EKOKE is fixed and the quantity of tokens given as reward will decrease over time. While the traditional mortgage system that is based on inflation and unsustainable interest rates is unsustainable, EKOKE is based on a deflationary model that will make it more valuable over time.
